##Resources Used
* [jQuery .css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) This gave me some further insight into the use of .css().
* I was able to piece together everything else from lectures and notes.

##Comments

I though this assignment was pretty straightforward. 

I manually removed the img tags from the article in the HTML before it occured to me that I could use jQuery to do so. I'm not sure if that's the way to go about it. My removal of img tags through jQuery occurs after I manually removed them in my commit log.
